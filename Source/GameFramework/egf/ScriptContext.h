    A class containing context data that is needed during scripted behavior calls.

    There is a global instance of this class which contains all the state needed during Behavior
    execution.  This state is setup by the Scheduler and the ISchedulerScripting instances
    whenever a script behavior is invoked or resumed.  Whenever the behavior makes calls back
    into C++ built-in APIs this context data is used to identify what Entity instance is running
    the behavior and which ServiceManager is managing this process.
