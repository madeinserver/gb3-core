/**
    A frame event is an event that occurs once per frame while your application is running for
    which various responders can perform work in a specific order. Services interested in the event
    can register to be notified each time the event occurs. Frame events work in conjunction with
    system services and are invoked interspersed with the registered services during the OnTick
    phase of each frame. As such, the events themselves use the same priority system that controls
    the ticking of services, but in addition each handler for the event is also registered with a
    specific priority and the handlers are invoked in priority order. In fact, frame events are very
    similar to sending a local message but with the addition of being able to control the handler
    invocation order using priority. The other difference between a local message and a frame event
    is that the handler methods for frame event are invoked through a specific interface function
    that is defined by the event itself. Objects handling a specific frame event must derive from
    an interface specific to the event they wish to handle and override a method which is also
    specific to that event. There is no "IMessage"-like payload associated with a frame event.

    Frame events are typically added to the ServiceManager during the OnInit phase of an owning
    system service and are removed during the OnShutdown phase of the same service. Well-known
    frame events can then be used by other services to implement functionality related to the event.
    Any service that utilizes a frame event should also register a service dependency on the owning
    system service during their OnPreInit call.

    A service can also register itself as a handler for it's own frame event as a method of
    effectively receiving multiple "OnTick"-like function calls each frame at different priorities.

    @note If a frame event has the exact same priority as a system service, the system service will
    receive its OnTick call before the frame event is executed.

    @note  Once added to the ServiceManager, it assumes ownership of the frame event object and
    will delete the object when it is removed.
