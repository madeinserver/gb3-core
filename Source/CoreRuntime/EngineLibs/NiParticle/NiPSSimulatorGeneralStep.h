/**
    Encapsulates a Floodgate kernel that updates particle size, colors,
    and rotations.

    Size keys may be specified for this step. Additional properties control
    the time scaling and looping behavior of the size animations. Note that
    the size computed here is multiplied by the initial size of the particle,
    set in the emitter. This enables random particle sizes to still be scaled
    over the particle life.

    A grow time and a shrink time can be specified for this step. These
    control durations of time during which particles will grow from size 0.0
    to their specified size and will shrink from their radius to 0.0. The
    grow and shrink generation values specify which particle generation to use
    for the growing and shrinking action. The most common case is for the grow
    generation to be 0 and the shrink generation to be the highest generation
    supported by the particle system (so that particles will grow when born
    and shrink when dying). Grow and shrink is applied in addition to the
    animated size, so particles will grow and shrink regardless of their animated
    size.

    Color keys can be specified that define color animation over the lifetime
    of each particle.

    Rotation keys may be given to provide an additional rotation
    angle that is added to the particle's initial rotation value. The value derived
    from the keys is added to the rotation angle that is computed from the rotation
    speed for the particle. This allows the for random variation in the rotations
    through random variation in the rotation speed parameter. Furthermore,
    rotation keys are not typically used on mesh-based particles because a distinct
    set of rotation keys on the NiPSSimulatorMeshAlignStep object uses quaternions
    to animate 3D rotation of the mesh scene graph.

    All key-framed values are linearly interpolated (slerped in the case of
    rotations). It is valid to provide only a single key, in which case the
    given value will be treated as a constant over the life of the particle.
    The same set of keys is used for particles of all generations. If you
    would like different keys, then spawn dead particles into a different
    particle system.

    This step uses the NiPSSimulatorGeneralKernel Floodgate kernel. The kernel
    is only executed if one of the following conditions is met:

    - The grow time is greater than 0.0.
    - The shrink time is greater than 0.0.
    - There are size keys.
    - The particle system has colors and color keys have been specified.
    - The particle system has rotations.
