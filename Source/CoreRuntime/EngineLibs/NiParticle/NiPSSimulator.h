/**
    The mesh modifier that performs all particle system simulation.

    This class is required to be attached to an NiPSParticleSystem object. It
    uses Floodgate tasks to perform all the simulation of the particle
    system.

    The particle simulation work is done via a set of NiPSSimulatorStep
    objects, each of which encapsulates a single Floodgate kernel. Particle
    forces and colliders are simulated using these steps, along with other
    particle simulation tasks. See each specific step class for more
    information about them.

    The input and output Floodgate streams for each step are automatically
    remapped so that output streams from previous steps are used as input
    streams on subsequent steps if the streams refer to the same data. This is
    determined by comparing semantics strings. Each step declares a semantic
    string for each of its input and output streams. The semantics defined in
    NiPSCommonSemantics should be used to refer to particle data.

    This class ensures that the Floodgate kernel from the final step in the
    set of simulator steps is always executed in a stage after all other
    kernels. This is to allow NiPSSimulatorFinalStep to update the position
    and age of the particles after all forces, colliders, and other simulation
    tasks have been computed. As such, the final step attached to this class
    should always be an instance of the NiPSSimulatorFinalStep class.

    This class directly operates on the particle data exposed by
    NiPSParticleSystem. That data should not be accessed by any other code
    while the NiPSSimulator Floodgate tasks are executing.
