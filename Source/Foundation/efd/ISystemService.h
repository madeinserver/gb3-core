        can potentially provide additional aliases although this can be bypassed in order to
        override parent settings. The default implementation of this method in ISystemService does

        Called by the framework after the service has been registered and before the service

        Although you may query for the existence of other services, for example in order to cache
        a smart pointer to a tightly coupled service, at this point you should not call any methods
        on other services unless the method explicitly states it is safe to call during OnPreInit.
        If the method does not indicate it is safe to call from OnPreInit you should not call
        it since the service may not have had a change to setup yet and might fail to handle the
        method as a result. You should wait until OnInit before you rely on cross-service
        interaction. You may also register additional service dependencies during OnPreInit. You
        should not register additional aliases, those should be done during OnServiceRegistered.

        @note OnPreInit is called in the order services are registered.

        @param pDependencyRegistrar Services can use this interface to optional register
            dependencies which determine the order in which OnInit and OnShutdown will be called.

        it requires.  During the OnInit phase it should be safe or call methods on other services
        since all services will have had a chance to be pre-initialized already.  This phase is
        primarily intended for establishing cross-service relationships such as the registering
        of message handlers.  The OnInit phase is asynchronous meaning that you can stay in this
        phase for multiple ticks.  Once a service returns AsyncResult_Complete from OnInit on the

                will not receive future OnTick calls.

        additional calls. In some rare cases OnShutdown can be called even if OnInit has never been

        after OnPreInit was called but before OnInit was called.
