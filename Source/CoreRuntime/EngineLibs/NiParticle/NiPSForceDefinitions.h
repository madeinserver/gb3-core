/**
    Holds data structures used by particle forces.

    This class defines several structures that contain the data used by
    particle forces. They must be defined in a separate class so that they
    can be easily included in the NiPSSimulatorForcesKernel Floodgate kernel.

    New forces should add new struct definitions to this class.

    The structures included in this class are the following:

    - BombData
    - DragData
    - FieldData
    - AirFieldData
    - DragFieldData
    - GravityFieldData
    - RadialFieldData
    - TurbulenceFieldData
    - VortexFieldData
    - GravityData
