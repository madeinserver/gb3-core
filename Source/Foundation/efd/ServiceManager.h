    /**
        Register a frame event with the Service Manager. A frame event is a method of performing
        per-frame work by invoking an ordered list of handlers at a specific priority during the
        frame. Frame events run interspersed with ISystemService::OnTick calls and use the exact
        same priority system to control the overall order. If a service and a frame event have the
        same priority the service will receive OnTick before the frame event is invoked. Unlike
        system services, frame events are not state containing objects; they are more like message
        handlers for a locally sent message, but unlike message handlers the order in which various
        handlers is invoked is also controlled by an additional priority system. The handlers
        themselves are invoked using an interface and method that is specific to the frame event
        itself.

        The expected usage of this method is for an owning system service to allocate a frame event
        during or after its OnInit phase. This owning service will eventually unregister the event
        before the end of its OnShutdown phase. The service manager will hold a reference to the
        frame event and will release it once it has been unregistered. If desired, the owning
        service may continue to reference the frame event but it is recommend that the event be
        treated as protected data of the owning service (one reason for this is that frame events
        do not implement Foundation RTTI so they cannot safely be cast to other class types). Once
        a frame event is registered, various services including the owning service or any service
        that depends on the owning service can add handlers that will be invoked sequentially when
        the frame event is invoked.

        @param pEvent The frame event to register. It must have a unique name in order to register
            successfully.
        @param priority The priority at which this frame event will execute. If the special value
            efd::kUseDefaultPriotity is used, the priority will be determined by calling the
            efd::IFrameEvent::GetDefaultPriority method.
        @return True if the event was registered successfully. When a true value is returned the
            caller must eventually call UnregisterFrameEvent to remove the event.

        Add a handler to an already registered frame event. The provided IBase must implement the
        specific interface and method used by the frame event, which should be documented along
        with the frame event itself. The handler will be invoked in priority order each time the
        frame event is triggered, which will be once per frame so as long as the frame event is
        active.

        The typical usage of this method is to add frame event handlers during the OnInit phase
        of a system service and to unregister those handlers during OnShutdown. If the handler
        needs to toggle itself on or off frequently it is more efficient to perform that operation
        within the handler than to frequently call the Add/RemoveFrameEventHandler methods.

        @note Services adding frame event handlers, either directly or through another object
        managed by the service, should register a dependency on the system service which owns the
