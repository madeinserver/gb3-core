        The function to implement loading an asset from media.

        All derived classes must implement this function to load an asset from disk into a newly
        created AssetLoadResponse message. In typical usage, the AssetLoadResponse message is
        likely to be a derived class that includes asset-specific data handling. This function may
        be invoked in either of the threads allowed by the the GetThreadSafety() method.

        The message that is returned should be allocated using EE_NEW. Upon return the message is
        owned by the system and application level code must not delete it.

        A message should be returned even on error, with the error code in the message set
        appropriately.

        Loads are asynchronous. The return value to LoadAsset indicates that current state of the
        request. LOAD_RUNNING indicates the load is in progress and has not yet completed.
        LOAD_COMPLETE indicates the load has completed and the response is properly allocated
        and set. LOAD_FAILED indicates the load failed and the response is properly allocated
        and set.

        @param pFactoryManager The asset factory making the request. Any asset locates done by the
            loader must go through this manager.
        @param pRequest An instance of a load request. This is owned by the caller.
        @param o_spResponse reference-to-SmartPointer to the response. This is allocated by the
            loader. Ownership transfers to the caller through the smart pointer reference.
