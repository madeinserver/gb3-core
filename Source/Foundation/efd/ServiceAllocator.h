/**
    Create the common Foundation services needed by most applications. If you use a fairly
    standard configuration you can simply call this method to create, configure and
    register the services.

    This function always creates the following services: efd::ConfigManager,
    efd::MessageService, efd::AssetLocatorService and efd::AssetFactoryManager.

    In addition, unless logging is disabled by passing the fsaf_NO_LOGGING flag the
    efd::EnumManager service is created and EnumManager::LoadConfigOptions is called. If their
    is a Logger singleton it will also initialized by calling ILogger::ReadConfig. As such it is
    recommended that before you call CreateFoundationServices you create a logger and register it
    by calling efd::LoggerSingleton::Initialize and then add the default ILogDestination by calling
    ILogger::AddDest.

    @param pServiceManager The ServiceManager to which the services are registered
    @param argcInit The number of command line arguments, which is passed to the constructor
        of the efd::ConfigManager. Pass zero on platforms without a command line.
    @param argvInit The command line arguments, which are passed to the constructor of the
        efd::ConfigManager. Pass NULL on platforms without a command line.
    @param flags Flags from the ServiceAllocatorFlags enum to change default behavior
