/**
    The ToolSnapService is responsible for maintaining a list of snap points and snapping to those
    points as requested. These snap points can be created in the art package by artists and used
    to assist in positioning entities in tools.

    In order for two entities to snap together, they need to both have at least one snap point.
    The snap point system has a "stickiness" radius that defines how close two entities must be
    before a "snap" operation occurs. When the snap occurs, the two snap points are made to be
    coincident.
