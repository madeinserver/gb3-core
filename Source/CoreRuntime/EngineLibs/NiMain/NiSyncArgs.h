    Sync arguments are passed to mesh modifiers and other parallel
    tasks to convey data required for submitting and completing tasks.

    The class also defines the SyncPoint type for specifying times when
    an application must synchronize for some reason. Several Gamebryo standard
    sync points are also defined here in the SyncPoints enumeration.
