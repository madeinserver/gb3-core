/**
    A platform-independent wrapper class to handle memory tracking and
    debugging. There are four major areas of functionality provided by the
    memory tracker:

    Memory Debugging - Provide functionality to assist in tracking down common
    memory errors.

    Memory Leak Tracking - Provide functionality to detect and help correct
    leaked memory.

    Memory Logging - Provide functionality to understand an application's
    memory behavior over time.

    Memory Summary Statistics - Provide functionality to quickly get a snapshot
    of the memory behavior over time.

    Please see the notes for commentary on the supported functionality for
    the tracker.

    @note that while the MemTracker provides thread safety for itself and its
    internal allocator, all allocator classes should be responsible for their
    own thread-safety.

    @note Memory Debugging - The tracker provides several levels of debugging
    functionality to catch common memory errors. These errors are caught by
    using asserts. Should a user encounter one of the asserts, please read the
    comments surrounding the assert. The comment should provide useful clues
    about the source of the assert. The debugger can then be used to inspect
    the current AllocUnit for more information about the allocation.
    Additionally, there are several variables that can be used to help trap
    when certain memory errors occur once specific information is known about
    the memory.

    @note Memory Leaks - When the application exits, all currently active
    allocations will be reported. There are two formats for the report,
    output debug strings and an XML log file. These log file, stored as
    "Memory-Leaks.xml", can be viewed in a variety of packages. On the
    Windows platform, double-clicking the file will display the contents
    of the XML file filtered by the corresponding XSL stylesheet in your
    default web browser. Note that these logs can sometimes be very large
    and can take some time to load in Internet Explorer or Firefox. The debug
    strings will be visible if bOutputLeaksToDebugStream is set to true.
    In some packages, like Microsoft Developer Studio, double-clicking on the
    individual leak records in the output stream will open the code browser
    to the line in which the allocation occurred.

    @note Memory Logs - The tracker will write all allocation records to file
    as they are deallocated. These records, stored in "Memory-Overview.xml",
    can be viewed in a variety of packages. On the Windows platform,
    double-clicking the file will display the contents of the XML file
    filtered by the corresponding XSL stylesheet in your default web browser.
    Note that these logs can sometimes be very large and can take some time to
    load in Internet Explorer or Firefox.
