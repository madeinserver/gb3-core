/**
    The KFMCache class is a helper for the Animation Service that
    manages the locating, loading and caching of KFM files (NiActorManager objects).

    Applications may wish to interface to this class if they load KFMs outside of the
    Animation Service. Only one instance of the class may be initialized, so all services
    should obtain the single instance from the egmAnimation::AnimationService instance.
    
    The KFMCache class also managed reload requests for "gamebryo-animation" (KFM) and
    "gamebryo-sequence-file" (KF) files. It also manages the reload of the NIF file associated
    with an actor. Subscribers to the channel returned by the GetReloadCategory method
    will receive messages of type KFMCacheResponse when an asset refresh must be processed.

    The KFMCache requires the existence of a ecr::SceneGraphCache. Typically, a pointer to this
    cache may be obtained from the ecr::SceneGraphService.

    This class is not thread safe.
