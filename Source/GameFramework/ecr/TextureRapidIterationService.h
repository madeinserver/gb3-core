/**
    The texture rapid iteration service is responsible for handling rapid iteration of external
    textures.

    If a texture in the asset web is modified and the reload service is initialized, then this
    service will search through all NiSourceTexture objects for ones with a matching filename.
    Any matching textures will be reloaded from disk.

    The currently supported formats include:
     - BMP
     - DDS
     - SGI
     - TGA

    To add additional formats:
     - Register a subclass of NiImageReader capable of handling the format with NiDevImageConverter
     - Verify that the file extension is listed in the asset-web-config\MimeTagger.ini file, with a
       type of image\<whatever> (this service watches for assets with a tag including "image")

   Additional notes:
     - This class will do no work if a RapidIterationSystemService instance is not also registered
       with the service manager.
     - The AppPixelData will be destroyed as part of reloading a texture when it is rapidly
       iterated.  Titles using this service should not cache pointers returned from
       pkTexture->GetSourcePixelData().
     - As with all other rapid iteration mechanisms, it is recommended that this service is not
       used in a shipping title (wrap service creation/registration in an
       if !defined(EE_CONFIG_SHIPPING)).
