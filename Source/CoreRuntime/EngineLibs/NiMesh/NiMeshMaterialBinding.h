        NiMeshMaterialBinding::CreateBinding.

        Each platform extends CreateBindingBaseContext to contain data members
        relevant to creating the binding for that platform. For example,
        NiDX9MeshMaterialBinding would invoke
        CreateBindingContext<DX9CreateBindingContext>. The subclass would
        include storage for an array of D3DVERTEXELEMENT9 objects necessary

        CreateBindingBaseContext or interface with it directly.

            Since each platform must interface with the underlying graphics
            API, this function is called after each entry is added to the
            mesh material binding to create any platform specific
