/**
    This class is an implementation of a circular or ring buffer.  CircularBuffer always leaves
    1 byte open so that it can distinguish between empty and full.  If CircularBuffer is  used in
    a single reader/single writer case no lock should be necessary.  The reader only ever writes
    to the read position and the writer only ever writes to the write position.  This leaves the
    buffer always in a valid state even if it is being both read and written to at the same time.
    In these cases only valid data is read, but either not all of the data is read/written.  The
    next call to Read/Write will pick up at the appropriate place.
