/**
    Represents a particle system that uses mesh particles instead of
    sprite-based particles.

    The main purpose of this sub-class of NiPSParticleSystem is to override
    the rendering and updating functions to deal with mesh particles. It holds
    a set of master particles, one for each particle generation. A master
    particle must be set for every generation prior to filling the particle
    pools, streaming, or cloning.

    Each master particle is just a scene graph that in most cases is a single
    NiMesh object but that could be any arbitrary graph of nodes and mesh
    objects. Master particles are owned by the NiPSMeshParticleSystem object,
    and unexpected behavior may occur if a master particle also exists in the
    scene graph and is modified there. In general, master particles should be
    cloned when being added if they also exist in the scene graph so that the
    particle system has its own copy of each master particle.

    When particles are emitted, the master particle of the matching particle
    generation is cloned, and the instanced particle is placed underneath a
    container node. Every frame, each particle is updated with its age,
    allowing time controllers attached in that particle's scene graph to
    properly animate. The container node is then culled and rendered like any
    other scene graph.

    To mitigate the memory thrashing that may occur when particles are
    allocated, cloned, and deleted, NiPSMeshParticleSystem holds pools of
    deleted mesh particles to be recycled. When a particle is removed from the
    particle system, it is added into its respective pool. When the system
    attempts to create a particle, it will first try to get one from the pools.
    The size of the pools is configurable by the user and is by default set to
    the maximum number of particles. When a mesh particle system is started
    for the first time, there may be a performance hit as lots of particles
    are cloned. To mitigate this problem you can preload the pools in code, or
    you can specify that the pools be initially filled during PostLinkObject
    when loading from a NIF (AutoFillPools).

        Creates an NiPSMeshParticleSystem object with the specified parameters.

        This function takes care of creating an NiPSMeshParticleSystem
        object and attaching an NiPSSimulator to it.

        @param uiMaxNumParticles The maximum number of particles allowed by
            this system. This determines the allocated size of all data arrays
            and cannot be changed.
        @param eNormalMethod The method to use for the normal direction when orienting particles.
        @param kNormalDirection The fixed direction vector to use for the normal direction when
            orienting particles with a fixed direction method.
        @param eUpMethod The method to use for the "up" direction when orienting particles.
        @param kUpDirection The fixed direction vector to use for the "up" direction when
            orienting particles with a fixed direction method.
        @param bHasLivingSpawner Whether or not living spawner data will be allocated.
        @param bHasColors Whether or not color data will be allocated.
        @param bHasRotations Whether or not rotation angle, speed, and axis
            data will be allocated.
        @param bWorldSpace Whether or not the particle system will compute its
            particles in world-space or local-space.
        @param bDynamicBounds Whether or not an NiPSBoundUpdater object will be
            attached to the particle system.
        @param bAttachMeshModifiers Whether or not the simulator mesh modifier
            will be attached when it is added.
        @param usNumGenerations The number of generations supported by the
            particle system. This determines how many master particles must be
            stored in the system.
        @param uiPoolSize The size to use for the pools of deleted mesh
            particles.
        @param bAutoFillPools Whether or not the pools of particles are
            automatically populated during streaming and cloning.
        @param fScaleAmount The amount of scaling increases as the speed increases.
            If negative, the particle will shrink as the speed increases.
        @param fScaleRest The scale when the speed is zero. This value must not be the same as
            the limit. If the Scale Amount is positive, this value must be less than the limit.
            If the Scale Amount is negative, it must be greater than the limit.
        @param fScaleLimit The maximum value for scale (or the minimum if the scale amount is
            negative). The scale will approach this value as the speed goes to infinity.

        @return The newly created NiPSMeshParticleSystem object.
