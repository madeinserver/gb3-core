/**
    LoopedThread is a class designed to facilitate the use of threads that need to be reused
    multiple times.

    A common use for this class would be to allow an application to have a multithreaded update or
    culling pass.  Instead of recreating threads each frame in such a case, an application could
    use this class to repeatedly perform a task.

    @note Like a Thread, a LoopedThread is created suspended and must be resumed before it can be
    used.

    @note Each DoLoop() should be paired with a WaitForLoopCompletion() call after it.  DoLoop()
    cannot be called repeatedly to run the loop multiple times without blocking.

    @note LoopedThreads may be destroyed by deleting them (via destructor).  They may also be
    explicitly stopped via Shutdown().  Both Shutdown() and the destructor will wait until the
    loop procedure has finished running and will not interrupt it.  Shutdown() and the destructor
    will block until the loop has terminated (which is not necessarily when the thread procedure
    has terminated (return condition set, status set, etc...)  Once a thread has stopped, DoLoop()
    silently does nothing.

        Create a thread using a specified LoopedThreadProcedure and a stack size.

        There are no publicly defined constructors for this class.  Applications should create all
        threads through the static Create method to make sure the thread is properly initialized
        and managed.

        The thread does not take ownership of the LoopedThreadProcedure object so that a
        procedure may be shared across multiple worker threads.  Like Thread, all LoopedThreads
        are created in the SUSPENDED state and must be resumed before any loop iterations will
        run.
