/**
    This class acts as a replacement of the NiTStridedRandomAccessIterator, for
    special use only within the terrain library. Its primary purpose is to act
    as an abstraction layer between the raw stream data and the information it
    represents.

    This allows us to arbitrarily enable and disable morphing and compression
    on the data streams, change the number of components etc without having
    to modify the program flow in the rest of the terrain library.

    Currently this class supports Position, Normal and Tangent streams. UV and
    Index streams are not supported, since they are generally not affected by
    the NiTerrainConfiguration class.
