/**
    A platform-independent class designed to support 2 byte half-floats.
    The code is based off of ILM's half class and the licensing information
    for this class can be found in both the source and in the Third Party
    Code section of the Gamebryo documentation. The Float16  implementation
    uses 1 bit for sign, 5 bits for exponent, and 10 bits for the mantissa.
    The class is designed to operate similarly to the built-in C++ IEEE 754
    single-precision floating point type in terms of performing arithmetic
    expressions and inter-operations with floats and doubles.

    The Float16 class can represent positive and negative numbers whose
    magnitude is between roughly 6.1e-5 and 6.5e+4 with a relative error of
    9.8e-4. Numbers that are smaller than 6.1e-5 can be represented with an
    absolute error of 6.0e-8. Finally, all integers from -2048 to +2048 can
    be represented exactly.
