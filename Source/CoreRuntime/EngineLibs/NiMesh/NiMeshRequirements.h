/**
    This class holds the set of requirements that a NiMesh object
    must meet in order to support an associated shader, modifier, etc.

    These requirements are on the semantics present on the stream and
    all aspects of their formatting and storage.

    Each object holds an array of requirement sets. The requirements will be
    considered satisfied if all of the contents of any one set are satisified.

    The NiMeshRequirements class is used by the tool pipeline profile process
    and that system attempts to satisfies requirements from various modifiers
    and will use the first satisfiable set. As such, requirement sets should
    be specified with the most restrictive sets first.

        The various ways in which a stream interleaving request can be
        satisfied.

        STRICT_INTERLEAVE indicates that any semantic with the same streamID
        must be kept together - those semantics can not exist in separate
        data stream.

        CAN_SPLIT allows additional semantics to be specified in a stream, but
        allows for those semantics to be split apart if necessary. If those
        semantics are split apart, it is important to note that only other
        semantics having the same StreamID can exists with them.

        FLOATER indicates that the stream that the semantic is placed in
        doesn't matter. The FLOATER enumeration is used specifically by the
        tool pipeline profile system to allow a semantic to be merged into any
        stream that the profile needs the semantic to be in. In general,
        mixing FLOATERS with CAN_SPLIT and STRICT_INTERLEAVE streams should be
        avoided to ensure maximum flexibility.

        As an example, imagine that a profile specifies semantics A,B,C as
        CAN_SPLIT and gives each semantic the same streamID. Also imagine that
        a modifier specifies that A and B are optionally together (CAN_SPLIT)
        in the same stream but that C is marked as a FLOATER. In this
        situation, the merge will fail. When semantics are defined with
        STRICT_INTERLEAVE or CAN_SPLIT, the stream is being defined such that
        no other semantics can exist in that stream other than those
        specified.

        In the example given, the profile specifies that ABC can exist
        together in the same stream but that no other semantic can exist with
        it. It also allows for the semantics to be split apart and in any
        combination just as long as no other semantic is placed with it.
        Likewise, the modifier, by specifying semantics A and B as CAN_SPLIT
        and giving them the same streamID is ruling out that C can ever exist
        in that stream. In order for a successful merge to occur, the modifier
        should specify C as CAN_SPLIT, or alternatively, it should define
        semantics A and B as FLOATERS so that the profile will merge it in
        with semantic C.

        No concept exists at present for specifying that a subset of semantics
        should strictly be interleaved, but that any other semantic (a
        wildcard specification) may be added to the same stream.
