/**
    The Animation Service provides an interface and a set of script built-ins for interfacing with
    the Gamebryo animation system. The service allows seamless integration of entities, scripts,
    and behaviors with Gamebryo's animation system without the need for extensive custom code. The
    animation service performs several major functions. It handles loading of KFM and KF assets,
    provides script built-ins for starting and ending sequences, provides registration services for
    text key callbacks, and stores actor managers for each KFM asset which it uses for per-frame
    updates.

    The Animation Service notifies other services when Actor models are ready for use and
    then unavailale for use. These messages are always matched. Services wishing to be informed
    of such messages must subscribe to the channel returned by GetMessageCategory() and must
    register handlers for egmAnimation::ActorAddedMessage and egmAnimation::ActorRemovedMessage.
    Cache messages are sent on the same channel.

    The animation service also handles rapid iteration functionality for applications. When the
    service receives notification of an update to a file associated with an actor, it will
    attempt to update that asset with the new data in the file. This includes changes to
    the scene graph that is being animated and individual KF sequence files.

    The following properties can be rapidly iterated on in AnimationService:
     - KfmAsset
     - Attachments

    The following properties can not: (An entity must be deleted and re-added to change these.)
     - InitialSequence
     - IsKfmAssetShared
     - IsNifAssetShared
     - AccumulatesTransforms

    The Animation Service manipulates the pose (position and rotation) on entities with the
    Actor model using the following rules:
    - Animations that use accumulation, and hence implicitly move the character while it animates,
      modify the Position and Rotation properties of the entity to track the global position of
      the Accumulation Root node in the animated scene graph. Animations without accumulate do not
      modify the entity position. When operating in tool mode all pose updating is de-activated.
    - When the Position or Rotation of an entity with the Actor model is set by another
      system (from script, another service, or during rapid iteration) it is assumed that the
      new pose refers to the Accumulation Root of the actor. The delta between the current
      Accumulation Root pose and the given pose is applied to the Nif Root of the actor's
      scene graph. This will place the actor in the requested location while moving the initial
      pose so that the actor will be in the same place when the animationsare reset and played
      again.

    We recommend that there be no objects in the scene graph that are unaffected by the
    Accumulation Root (that is, not transformed by the Accumulation Root transform). Such objects
    will behave oddly when the pose on the character is reset and their position will not be that
    reported by the entity's position.
