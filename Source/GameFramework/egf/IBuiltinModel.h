        After the built-in model is "factoried", this method is called to associate the built-in
        model with its owning entity.  This is effectively part of the construction of the entity
        in question, as a result the owning entity is not yet fully constructed.  This means it
        is not yet valid to call most methods (for example, property and behavior related methods)
        on the owning entity during Initialize.

        It is possible that the owning entity might fail to be fully constructed even after you
        have successfully completed your initialization.  If this happens then the entity and
        your built-in model may be deleted with no further method calls.  As such you should
        avoid caching references to your built-in model implementation until the OnAdded method
        is invoked.  Otherwise a memory leak may result if the entity fails construction.

        The base class version of this method must be called if the method is overridden.
        The return value of the IBuiltinModel implementation should be ignored (see below).

        @param i_pOwner Owning entity.
        @param i_Defaults Default property descriptor list.

        possibly do a few lookups, and then call whatever existing API does the work.

        @param i_pBehaviorToInvoke Descriptor of the behavior to invoke.
        @param i_pArgumentList ParameterList consisting of all the arguments to this behavior.
