/**
    A platform-independent wrapper class for a simple semaphore.

    @note Some platforms support the concept of a maximum count for a semaphore.  On platforms
    that do not, the maximum count is bounded only by the maximum of the storage type used by the
    OS.  Regardless, the Semaphore class does not enforce this count internally, but relies on the
    OS for such management, due to the synchronization overhead that such enforcement would incur.
