/**
    This class represents a simple fixed-length buffer of nodes that cannot be resized.

    It does not internally track which nodes are free or used, but it is capable of determining
    if a given node is part of it's buffer, which allows it to be used as a useful component of
    other containers.  In this usage pattern, the outer container will create a fixed pool and
    initialize it's freelist with that pool.  If the freelist is exhausted and new allocations are
    created, then they will be individually deleted when ReleaseNode is called on them.
