/**
    The scene graph service is responsible for managing all the Gamebryo scene graphs that
    are in the system.

    Scene graphs come from a variety of sources. Most of the scene graphs are loaded for entities
    that have the NifAsset property, for use as rendered geometry. Other services may also
    provide scene graphs that have been loaded (such as the Animation Service) or
    created in code (such as the Light Service). Functions are provided for such services to
    register the scene graph with this service.

    The scene graph service registers with entity lifetime messages so the scene graphs
    associated with entities are automatically loaded and prepared for rendering. It also registers
    for property update messages on entities, and applies relevant property changes to the scene
    graphs.

    The scene graph service requires that a efd::MessageService object be available at the
    time the SceneGraphService object is added to the ServiceManager. Hence, the Message Service
    must be registered before the Scene Graph Service.
