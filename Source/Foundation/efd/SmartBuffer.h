/**
    A SmartBuffer is a sized window into a GrowableBuffer.  They can be quickly and cheaply
    copied since they share a reference to the actual memory through the GrowableBuffer.  The
    internal GrowableBuffer is automatically maintained so you can effectively think of
    SmartBuffer as being a generic resizable memory buffer that can be cheaply "copied" around.
    The practical result of this is that SmartBuffer instances are typically placed on the
    stack rather than being allocated from the heap.
