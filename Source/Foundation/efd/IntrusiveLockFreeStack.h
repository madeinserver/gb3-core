/**
    This is an implementation of an intrusive single-producer, single-consumer lock-free stack.

    When a node is pushed into the stack, the stack takes ownership for the node.
    When a node is popped from the stack, the stack gives ownership to the caller.

    This class does no memory allocations or deletions unless nodes are left in it at destruction
    time.

    The NodeType template parameter is required to have a public member "NodeType* m_pNext" which
    will be used as part of the stack data structure for the duration of it's stay in the stack.
    There are no other requirements on NodeType.

    /**
        Constructs a single-reader, single-writer lock-free stack.

        The producer and consumer threads must be different.

        Single-reader: Only one thread (the consumer thread) may be issuing calls to
                       Pop at any given time.
        Single-writer: Only one thread (the producer thread) may be issuing calls to
                       Push at any given time.

        The producer and consumer threads can/should be different.  A single thread may act as
        both producer and consumer only if there are no other threads producing or consuming at
        that time (the key is that there should never be multiple producers or multiple consumers).

        These requirements are not internally enforced (if ignored, the container will become
        inconsistent).  For example, it is up to the caller to ensure that only one thread is
        acting as a producer at any given moment.

        Requirements on NodeType:
         - T must have a public member NodeType* m_pNext.

        be reused by the producer until the consumer frees it, which must happen after it's left the
