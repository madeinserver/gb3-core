/** @file BuiltinModelHelper.h

    This file contains helpers to make implementing a built-in model easier.

    You can use this to implement IBuiltinModel methods and bind properties and methods.  The
    result will be a map based lookup from static data every time a built-in model method is
    invoked.

    @code
    class MyBuiltinModel : public IBuiltinModelImpl

/**

    Used to begin a block of built-in model property bindings.  This declares the static methods
    that are needed to implement the built-in model.  You must end the block of property defines
    using the EE_END_BUILTINMODEL_PROPERTIES macro. You must also add the implementation macro
    EE_IMPLEMENT_BUILTINMODEL_PROPERTIES to your .cpp file.

    We don't use SDM here because we would have to remember to add every Builtin Model class
    to the SDM init chain. Instead, we'll manage the life time of each IBuiltinModelImpl instance
    such that we initialize and clean up our static data in the correct order. This will only
    work if you derive your builtin model classes from efd::BuiltinModelImpl or you call
    InitializePropertyMap in your constructor and ReleasePropertyMap in your destructor.
