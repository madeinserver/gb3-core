/**
    The NiSPWorkflowManager class handles the submission and buffering of
    tasks for placement into workflows for execution.

    There are two primary reasons for its existence:

    (1) On some platforms, specific sized workflows are more efficient than
        arbitrarily sized workflows.

    (2) Under some circumstances, it is convenient for tasks to be buffered
        before submission.

    Task groups are used to prevent tasks from appearing in the same workflow.
    Only tasks with the same task group will appear in the same workflow.
    They are useful when an application wishes to delay the submission of
    certain tasks. The delayed tasks can be given their own group ID, and
    they will be placed in the same workflow. Other tasks will be placed in
    other workflows and may be submitted sooner.

    Tasks can be marked for delayed execution at the time they are added.
    Delayed tasks must be explicitly forced to submit for execution through
    a call to the FlushTaskGroup function.

    @note This class is not thread-safe. Each thread in an application should
        use a separate instance.

        Set the submit threshold value.

        The submit threshold is the minimum number of tasks a workflow must
        have before it is automatically submitted. A workflow with fewer
        tasks can always be flushed to force submission.

        The submit threshold should be set on a per application, or even per
        workflow manager, basis to optimize the trade-off between delaying
        workflow submissions versus having maximally sized workflows. In cases
        where tasks are rapidly submitted to the manager and any given task
        can afford to wait a little on submission, the submit threshold can
        be larger. If tasks come in infrequently or it is important that each
        start as soon as possible, then the submit threshold should be lower.

        Note that on some platforms the submit threshold may need to be raised
        to limit the maximum number of workflows outstanding at any given
        moment. A higher threshold means more tasks per workflow and hence
        fewer workflows for a given application.
