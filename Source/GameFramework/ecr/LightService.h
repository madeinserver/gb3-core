/**
    LightService is a Gamebryo service which manages light sources and the lists of entities which
    they affect. LightService uses a simple range based algorithm to determine which renderable
    entities are affected by which lights. LightService also manages shadow generators (optionally
    associated with directional, point, and spot lights), as well as the lists of entities which
    may cast and/or receive shadows.

    When determining which lights are within range, the light service computes the variance of
    light ranges across the three cardinal axes. Using the axis with the largest variance, it
    ignores light to entity pairings which can not affect each other. Each potential pairing
    undergoes a more comprehensive test to determine if a light affects an entity.
