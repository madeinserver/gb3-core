    viewers.

    The caller can insert arbitrary NiObjects into this object along with a unique ID. The
    objects will then be replicated to any NiViewerSceneGraphUpdate objects that have connected
    to this object's ChannelManager service. Likewise, the editor can set the root node, current
    camera, and config settings that will be sent to all viewers.
