        Serialize a polymorphic type to or from an Archive. This method must be overridden, but if
        your streamable object has no data the override can be an empty function. A typical
        implementation of this method will make one call to efd::Serializer::SerializeObject for
        each member of the class. If you are derived from another streamable class you should be
        sure to call to parent implementation of this method as well; it is recommended that the
        parent class be serialized first before adding the data for the derived class. If your class
        contains complex data such as STL-style contianers or pointers to allocated data then you
        can simplify the implementation of Serialize by using the templated helper functions in
        <efd/SerializeRoutines.h>; these can serialize even the most complex data structures
        with a single method call and will reduce the chance of making common mistakes (which could
        introduce security vulnerabilities if marshalling data from untrusted sources).
