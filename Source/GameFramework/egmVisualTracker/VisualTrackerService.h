/**
    This service provides a graphical display for tracking performance over time or
    other statistics.  There is built-in support for tracking frame rate, memory
    allocations, entity locations and some other common metrics.

    The set of items to display is controlled by the configuration system. See the
    Configuration Options Quick Reference page for a summary.

    The VisualTrackerService depends on the ecr::RenderService service and the
    efd::MessageService service. Users may wish to configure the visual tracker using
    the ConfigService. To do this, simply create a new section, "[VisualTracker]". To adjust
    the maximum values for Performance charts, create a variable called "PerfMaxValue" and set
    to the new maximum. Similarly, users can set the maximums for Timing charts with
    "TimingMaxValue" and Memory charts with "MemMaxValue". Additionally, individual service
    timings can be captured by setting a variable named "ServiceTrackers" with the count of
    trackers. Subsequent variables like "ServiceY" should be set with the Service ID of the
    service you wish to track. The "Y" variable should be the numeric index of the service
    to track, so the first service would be "Service0". Colors may also be specified per
    service using "ServiceYColor". Again, the "Y" variable name should be the service index.

    The configuration system is also used to control the display of an entity location scatter
    plot.
