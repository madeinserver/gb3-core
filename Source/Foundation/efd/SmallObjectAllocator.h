/**
    A platform-independent class to support pooling of small allocations.

    This allocator is based on the SmallObjectAlloctor described by Alexei Alexandrescu in Modern
    C++ Design.  The latest code for Loki (the codebase containing the SmallObjectAllocator) may
    be found at http://sourceforge.net/projects/loki-lib/.  The licensing information for this
    class may be found in the Third Party Code section of the documentation.  Also of importance
    is the fact that allocation thread safety responsibility is passed onto the FixedSizeAllocator
    objects.

    @note All sizes from 1 to EE_MAX_SMALL_OBJECT_SIZE will receive their own internal allocation
    pool.  This approach helps conserve memory, since this class is a small object allocator.  The
    current track of Alexandrescu's code enforces alignment restrictions that bloat the size for
    small object allocations.  Please see the alignment note which follows for more justification
    for this design decision.  Also note that the size of an allocation must be known at
    deallocation time.  Absence of this knowledge will currently make it impossible to delete the
    allocation.  Please see "Modern C++ Design" by Andrei Alexandrescu for strategies that enable
    the deallocator to know how large the allocation was without storing a size per instance.

    @note Allocations for a given size are only guaranteed to be aligned if the size of the
    request itself is aligned.  For example, all 8-byte allocations will be aligned to at least a
    4-byte boundary, since the beginning of a pool is aligned to EE_MEM_ALIGNMENT_DEFAULT.
    However, 7-byte allocations are not guaranteed to be aligned.  This scheme works in practice
    for classes, since the class size will be a multiple of the largest alignment requirement for
    the members of the class.

    The FixedSizeAllocator class is used by SmallObjectAllocator internally for allocation
    management.  FixedSizeAllocator allocates memory of a particular size from an internal pool of
    memory chunks.  When no more chunks have open slots, a new chunk will be allocated.  Note that
    each FixedSizeAllocator has a critical section that manages its various chunks.  This approach
    can improve memory performance in a multi-threaded environment.
