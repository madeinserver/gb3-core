    @class BuiltinModelDescriptor

    @brief A data based description of a built-in model

    Built-in models provide a method for implementing models as C++ objects as opposed to
    generic property bags.  The BuiltinModelDescriptor is created when parsing the FlatModel
    definition of an entity that uses built-in models.  Built-in models are also models but when
    loading a model that mixes in built-in models we don't need the complete FlatModel description
    for the built-in so a simplified BuiltinModelDecriptor is used instead.  This description
    can be created from the derived Flat Model without having to also load the built-in model's
    Flat Model.

    When an Entity is created from a FlatModel a list is generated of all the built-in models
    that are mixed in.  This list is then used to factory the correct C++ objects to implement
    these built-in models.
