/**
    \brief Resolves names to ip addresses and other information.

    Similar to ZeroConf, mDNS, SSDP, or SLP (rfc 2608 http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2608).  Works
    on a local network only.

    Every service maintains a cache of responses.  When the NameResolutionService is queried, it
    will send a response message immediately if it has information in the cache, but will also
    send out a new request if that information is too old.  A second response will be sent locally
    with updated information if a response to the external query comes back with different data
    than what is in the cache.

    One of the drawbacks of mDNS is that a daemon must be installed on each machine.  To get
    around this limitation, NameResolutionService attempts to bind to a well known port; if the
    binding fails, it assumes that there is a service running that will respond to requests.  On a
    regular interval, NameResolutionService attempts to rebind to the port in case the process
    that was using the port released it.

    ServiceAnnouncements and requests are broadcast; responses are unicast.

    NameResolutionService listens for incoming unicast response messages on a private port
    assigned by the OS.  This port is sent in the request message so that the
    NameResolutionService bound to the well known port knows where to target the response.  In
    practice, the port will most likely be the local port assigned when the request is sent.

    Requests will be assigned a request ID, but responses to those requests will be sent in the
    form of 1 or more local messages.  If no response can be given within a timeout, a message
    will be sent indicating that the timeout has been exceeded with no response.  Any cached
    values will be sent as local messages immediately with any remote responses arriving within
    the timeout that are not already in the cache being sent locally as they arrive.  A structure
    will be kept for each request to keep track of state, including request time and cached
    responses already sent.
