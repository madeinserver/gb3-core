    NiSurface objects are used to describe different patches of terrain.

    An NiSurface object can be painted onto the terrain to create patches
    of grass, sand, snow, gravel, etc. This class is mainly used to define
    how these patches will be rendered by correlating all the relevant data
    ready to be sent to the NiTerrainMaterial.
