/**
    The SceneGraphCache class is a helper for the scene graph service designed to pull code that
    manages the locating, loading and caching of scene graphs out of the Scene Graph Service.

    The SceneGraphCache class also managed reload requests for "gamebryo-scenegraph" (nif) files.
    Subscribers to the channel returned by the GetReloadCategory method
    will receive messages of type KFMCacheResponse when an asset refresh must be processed.

    Applications may wish to interface to this class if they load NIFs outside of the Scene
    Graph Service.

    This class is not thread safe.
