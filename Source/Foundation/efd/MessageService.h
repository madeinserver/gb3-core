/**
    MessageService implements message sending through a Category based publish-subscribe model.
    Message delivery callbacks are created statically using the various EE_HANDLER macros and are
    then dynamically associated with a Category through the Subscribe method. Messages are pushed
    to a given Category using the various Send methods and all interested callbacks are notified.

    The message service can be extended to support networking through the addition of a NetService
    while continuing to support the exact same publish-subscribe model. This allows code to be
    written identically to support either local or online scenarios.
