/**
    Represents a particle system.

    This class is derived from NiMesh and overrides its update and rendering
    functions to implement a particle system simulation. It requires an
    NiPSSimulator object to be attached to it in order for the simulation to
    work properly. In most cases, a particle generator mesh modifier, such
    as NiPSFacingQuadGenerator, will also be attached to convert particle
    data into renderable data streams.

    All per-particle data is stored in dynamically allocated arrays owned by
    this object. These arrays are not shared between NiPSParticleSystem
    clones. Several checks are in place to ensure that the particle data is
    not accessed by more than one thread simultaneously. If an application
    needs to access the particle data, it must first call
    ForceSimulationToComplete to ensure that all mesh modifiers that may be
    using the data are forced to complete.

    @note The NiPSParticleSystem constructor is protected and cannot be called
        directly. The static Create function should be used instead.
