        automatically cast into utf8char_t types in cases where that might not be valid.  Casting
        a raw char into a utf8char_t is dangerous because technically that character is connected
        to a locale which must be used to convert the character to Unicode before we assign the
        value.  We aren't doing that step; instead we are simply assuming the char is a valid
        7-bit ASCII value.  In the case of int conversion, we are assuming the int is already a
        UTF32 value.  By making these constructors explicit, the caller will need to think about
        whether these assumptions are valid.
