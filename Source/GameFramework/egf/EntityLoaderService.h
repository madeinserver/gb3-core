/**
    The EntityLoaderService is an efd::ISystemService that is responsible for listening to and
    responding to Entity Set (block) Load and Unload requests. The process of loading and unloading
    a set of entities is performed in an ISystemService to allow for asynchronous loading of
    Entities. Entities are loaded / unloaded during the EntityLoaderService OnTick invocation by
    the Service world Manager.

    The EntityLoaderService uses the AssetLocatorService to find assets related to the Entity.
    If the RapidIterationService is enabled the Asset load requests can be forwarded to a remote
    AssetServer.

    Only one xblock file can be loaded per request. If you need to load multiple block files,
    you'll need to request them one at a time.

    Unload requests must use the same AssetID that was used to load the block.

        entities from all loading blocks; blocks will be loaded in the order requested until the
        limit is reached and remaining loading will continue on the next tick.

        If your game can preload blocks well in advance you may wish to use a low throttle to avoid
        possible frame rate hitches caused by loading and creating too many entities at once.
        Conversely, if you want to load a large block as quickly as possible regardless of frame
        rate hitches than you should use a large throttle.
