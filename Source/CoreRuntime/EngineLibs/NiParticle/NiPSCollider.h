/**
    An abstract base class for all particle colliders.

    Multiple colliders can be owned by an NiPSSimulatorCollidersStep object,
    which is attached to the NiPSSimulator mesh modifier of a particle system.
    Each collider provides a block of memory that contains the data it needs
    to properly execute. In its Update function, it updates that data as
    necessary. The NiPSSimulatorCollidersStep object will concatenate the data
    from all its colliders into a single data buffer that gets sent to a
    Floodgate kernel.

    In order to apply its collision behavior inside the Floodgate kernel, two
    functions need to be added for each collider to the NiPSColliderHelpers
    class: one to detect a collision and one to handle it. For each particle,
    the NiPSSimulatorCollidersKernel Floodgate kernel loops over all the
    colliders, calling the collision detection function for each and providing
    that collider's data buffer to that function. The closest collider that
    returns a positive result will have its collision handler function called
    for the particle, which takes care of updating the particle's position and
    velocity appropriately.

    An NiPSSpawner object may be optionally associated with a collider, which
    will be used if the collider is set to spawn upon collision. There is also
    an option for particles to die upon collision.
