/**
    RefCountObject provides a concrete implementation of reference counting. This allows an
    object to delete itself when no more references are held.

    RefCountObject is intended for use in single inheritance situations where performance is
    critical.  The increment and decrement functions are non-virtual which makes the common
    operations for maintaining the reference count quicker at the cost of preventing multiple
    derivation from RefCountObject.  If you require multiple inheritance (or runtime typing)
    then you should use efd::IBase instead of this class.

    The signatures for these methods mirror those used in efd::IBase, so you can use a RefCount
    as the concrete implementation for an IBase derived class by using the forwarded reference
    macro, EE_DECLARE_FORWARDED_CONCRETE_REFCOUNT.  If you do this you still must ensure that
    only a single RefCountObject instance provides your concrete reference count implementation.

    Pass in either NonAtomicRefCount or AtomicRefCount as the template argument for this class.
    Use AtomicRefCount if your object will be used from multiple threads, or NonAtomicRefCount
    for a faster implementation that can only be used from one thread at a time.
