/**
    The RenderService service manages renderable objects and the renderer itself.

    A platform specific renderer is created at startup, based on parameters provided
    to the constructor or given after construction but before initialization.

    The render service maintains a set of RenderSurface objects, each describing a
    particular render window. Each surface may be associated with a particular
    Ni3DRenderView object that holds the scene graph objects to draw in that surface.
    Typical game applications will have only one surface, while tools may have several.

    Scene graph objects are given to the service to manage, typically by the
    SceneGraphService service. The render service then places the scene graph in the
    appropriate Ni3DRenderView object. Currently, all scene graphs are added to all
    views, but this will likely change in future to give applications control over
    which objects appear in which views.

    On each framework tick, all of the surfaces are updated, which causes them to draw.
