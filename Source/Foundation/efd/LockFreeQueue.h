/**
    This is an implementation of a single-reader, single-writer lock-free queue.

    Single-reader: Only one thread (the consumer thread) may be issuing calls to
                   Consume at any given time.
    Single-writer: Only one thread (the producer thread) may be issuing calls to
                   Produce or ReclaimSpace at any given time.

    The producer and consumer threads can/should be different.  A single thread may act as
    both producer and consumer only if there are no other threads producing or consuming at
    that time (the key is that there should never be multiple producers or multiple consumers).

    These requirements are not internally enforced (if ignored, the container will become
    inconsistent).  For example, it is up to the caller to ensure that only one thread is
    acting as a producer at any given moment.

    Requirements on T (the type of values stored in the queue):
     - T must have an accessible default constructor
       (i.e., T value = T(); must be a valid statement).
     - T must have an accessible assignment operator (which will be invoked when objects are
       produced into the queue, or consumed from the queue)
    These are naturally satisified by pointer and integral types.

    The constructor takes an initial size reservation parameter to prevent per-operation memory
    allocation, and as long as the working size of the queue is below the initial size, no
    operation on the queue will force a context switch.

        the queue, it will grow by dynamically allocating additional nodes, so it is a good idea
        to conservatively choose a large-enough initialSize.  As long as the working size of the
        queue is below the initial size, no operation on this queue will force a context switch.

        Since allocations could cause a temporary lock inside of the memory manager, a warning
        will be emitted by the destructor in debug builds if the initialSize parameter was too
        small.

    The underlying implementation is a singly-linked-list with tracking of the head, tail, and a
    divider node, which points to the last consumed node (to keep this pointer valid, there will
    always be a dummy node present in the list, even if there were no nodes produced).

    The divider node allows the producer to work on one side, and the consumer on the other side.

    Nodes before the divider can be lazily freed by the producer (they have already been consumed),
    nodes after the divider are the active queue that the consumer consumes.  The divider always
    points to a 'dummy' node, with a valid next pointer that indicates the top of the queue.

    No need to worry about the 'ABA' problem, since only one thread can produce and only one
    thread can consume.  The producer cannot reuse an address in the midst of the consumer working,
    since only the consumer updates the divider, and the producer won't reuse it until it's on the
    production side of the divider.

    Producer owns:
      - The ability to update m_pHead and m_pTail
      - The contents of all nodes before the m_pDivider node
      - The next pointer of the tail node (m_pTail->m_pNext)

    Consumer owns:
      - The ability to update m_pDivider
      - The contents of all nodes after (and including) m_pDivider node
        except for m_pTail->m_pNext
