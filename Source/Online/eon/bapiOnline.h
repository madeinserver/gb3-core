// NOTE: This is a SWIG parsed file.  All methods listed in this file will have script wrappers

//
// A note on argument types:
//
// Given any type the SWIG generated bindings will make certain assumptions about whether the
// parameter is an input argument, and output argument, or an input-output argument.  Given
// a type T, it will be treated as follows:
//
//    |---------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------
//    | typename:     | treated as:   | notes:
//    |---------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------
//    | T             | Input         |
//    | const T&      | Input         |
//    | const T*      | Input         | Pointer must NOT be NULL
//    | T*            | Output        | Pointer must NOT be NULL
//    | T&            | Input-Output  |
//    |---------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------
//
// The one exception to the argument type rules above is efd::ParameterList.  efd::ParameterList*
// is treated as a basic type for the purpose of these rules, not efd::ParameterList itself.  For
// example, this means that "efd::ParameterList*" is treated as a plain ParameterList Input argument
// and "efd::ParameterList*&" is treated as an in-out efd::ParameterList parameter.  One additional
// special case, for convenance "efd::ParameterList&" is also treated as an in-out parameter.
