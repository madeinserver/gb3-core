        @note Interaction between this setting and the default setting in the EntityLoaderService
            is if fairly complicated:
        - If this setting is higher then the default EntityLoaderService value:
            When loading of this block begins the ELS will switch to using the higher value. Once
            this block finishes the ELS value will return to the default. If a previous block was
            loaded before your block the number of entities already loaded are counted against the
            new threshold. If additional block loads are queued they can proceed this tick only if
            the entities loaded this tick are below the resulting threshold.
        - If this setting is lower than the default EntityLoaderService value:
            When this block begins to load the lower limit will be considered. If a previous block
            has already loaded this tick the reduced limit could already be exceeded in which case
            loading of this block will be delayed until the next tick. After considering this block
            the normal limit will be restored and the next queued block load will be considered.
            Even if this block was skipped due to the limit the next block may still be loaded if
            it is under the restored limit.

        @param override The maximum number of entities to create each tick when loading this block.
            The special value k_Unlimited can be used to ensure the entire block is loaded in a
            single tick. The special value k_UseDefaultLimit will ensure that the default value
