/**
    Updates the particle velocity to simulate the effects of air movements
    like wind, fans, or wake.

    The field object, direction, and inherit rotation define the location and
    orientation of the air field. The magnitude defines the maximum velocity
    in particle space. Inherit velocity describes how much of the air field's
    velocity is added to the magnitude and direction of the air field.

    It is important to remember that this class dynamically computes the
    velocity of the air field from frame to frame. Radically changing the
    position of the field object can cause large instantaneous velocities, so
    ClearLastFieldPosition should be called in such a case.

    Here are some settings to define typical effects:

    - Wind
        - Magnitude = wind speed
        - Inherit Velocity = 0.0
        - Inherit Rotation = false
        - Use Spread = false
    - Fan
        - Magnitude = air speed
        - Inherit Velocity = 0.5
        - Inherit Rotation = true
        - Use Spread = true
    - Wake
        - Magnitude = 0.0
        - Inherit Velocity = 1.0
        - Inherit Rotation = true
        - Use Spread = false
