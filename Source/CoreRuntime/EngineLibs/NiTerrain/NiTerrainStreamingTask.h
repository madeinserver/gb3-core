/**
    This class contains all the functionality required to load, unload or rebuild a terrain.

    It consists of a set of jobs, each in the form of a function. Most jobs are not 
    parallelizable, in that it can only be split up into a single work unit. The building task can 
    be split up into multiple work units, which can run over multiple threads. When a job is split,
    it will not be removed from the relevant queue until all work units have been allocated threads.
