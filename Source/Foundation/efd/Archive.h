/**
    An Archive provides the storage media for data marshaling.  You can toss objects into the
    archive using Serialize and then later use the exact same code to retrieve the objects.
    Archives help protect against data overflows and underflows too.

    Sample usage for packing:
    @code
        Archive ar(Archive::Packing);
        Serializer::SerializeObject(object1, ar);
        ...
        Serializer::SerializeObject(objectN, ar);
        if (!ar.GetError())
        {
            SmartBuffer sbResult = ar.GetUsedBuffer();
            // sbResult now contains the marshaled data, it could be written to the wire or
            // persisted to disk or whatever.
        }
    @endcode

    Sample usage for unpacking:
    @code
        Archive ar(Archive::Unpacking, pData, cbData);
        Serializer::SerializeObject(object1, ar);
        ...
        Serializer::SerializeObject(objectN, ar);
        ar.CheckForUnderflow();
        if (!ar.GetError())
        {
            // use the unpacked results
        }
    @endcode
